<title>Clackamas River rafters rescued after being stranded on riverbank</title>
<link>http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20140309/NEWS/140309004/1001</link>
<description>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Authorities have rescued three adults who were stranded on the Clackamas River after their small raft hit debris and sank.
The Clackamas County Sheriff&apos;s Office says rescue crews on Saturday found the three out of the water on a rock outcropping on the river east of Estacada. Rescuers used a raft to navigate the river and bring them to safety. There were treated and released at the scene.
The group had launched the raft around noon. They were able to make it to shore when the raft sank. They built a warming fire and waited until someone saw them and called 911.
Sgt. Nate Thompson says the river was running higher than usual. He warns that rivers are cold, fast and full of debris, and says people should remember to wear personal flotation devices.</description>
